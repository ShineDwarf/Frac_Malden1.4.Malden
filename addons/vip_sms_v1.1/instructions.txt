SMS Install Instructions:

1. Place the "vip_cmn" and "vip_sms" folders in the ROOT of your mission folder. If "vip_cmn" already exists, use whichever folder is the latest version.
2. In the mission's Description.ext, add (or insert, if the cfgFunctions class already exists):


	class CfgFunctions {

		#include "vip_cmn\fn\vip_cmn_fnc.hpp"
		#include "vip_sms\fn\vip_sms_fnc.hpp"
	};

	#include "vip_cmn\resource\vip_dlg_defaults.hpp"
	#include "vip_sms\resource\vip_sms_dlg.hpp"


3. Done!

***WARNING***: As of Arma 3 1.40, there is still no way to remove default object actions (such as "Deactivate mine"). This means that if a player is of the "Engineer" or "Explosive Specialist" class and are carrying a Toolkit, they can remove the mines using the default Arma system, which BREAKS the scripts of SMS. Use at your own caution, and design your missions accordingly.


Using the mines:
